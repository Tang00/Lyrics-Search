I can see through you  
From where you're sitting, pretty one  
I know it got to you

You give your life for rock n' roll  
Uh huh  
  
Stand, we're on a landslide of love  
You got everything you want  
But what you need you give away  
  
For primitive love  
And a ride on the mystery train

Turning tricks, you're on the street  
Selling your kisses so bittersweet

I will wait for you

I will write for you

Who must appear  
In veils of chance  
And mystery  
I will kneel  
I will kneel  
Like a child  
Who's watching Mary  
As she stands  
Upon the air  
In gentle splendour  
In the black  
Mouth of a cave  
Open-armed and radiant  
To save mankind  
And all the broken  
World to mother  
  
And I swear  
By the obscure  
Truth  
Of this  
Enfolded heart  
I swear  
By  
The unrequited greed  
Of this  
Human heart  
And all  
Its  
Disappointed pleasures  
I swear  
By  
The deep light  
Of my soul  
Stained  
And covered over  
With  
Intrigues of pride  
Whose mercy is  
To let me sing  
I swear  
That I will be  
For the one  
Who will not come  
To me  
I swear that  
I will be  
Her lover  
Her eternal  
And imperfect  
Spirit lover.

[Verse 2: John Legend]  
All that bubbly, all that wine  
Oh man, look at the times  
Didn't they notice, notice?  
Only future I can see, ain't what it used to be  
And I didn't know this, I didn't know this  
Once you're above the city lights  
Won't want to spend another night, down there on your own  
The holding on is made for us  
The altitude is dangerous, but we ain't going home  
  
[Chorus: John Legend]

Can't keep us out no more (let's go, let's go, let's go)

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]  
I heard this old joke once, it was like, uh  
Knock knock, who there, it's us, us who?  
Just us, who dis? Just playin'  
Just me, new phone, new hair, new era  
I'm in the penthouse, baby  
Handpicked from bad apples and bad eggs  
Held back, I had to grab crab legs  
And then there were only but a few  
Conversations held with patience, what a party, what a view  
What a dress, what a song  
What a beautiful time  
My folks downstairs still waitin' in line  
They never been in these rooms  
Never stayed with these folks  
Never laughed at the news, never hated these jokes  
So as I fly in my suit, in a group, undercover  
Forcin' a new smile, he tells me another  
He said ""What happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk?""  
Then he pushed me off the top and said ""Jump, nigga, jump!""  
  
[Bridge: John Legend]  
Oh, don't bring me down, I need a room in the clouds  
I wanna get there babe, I wanna elevate  
Oh my favorite mix, a little ignorance and bliss  
In the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse  
  
[Chorus: John Legend]  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for  
We'll tear down those penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Those penthouse doors  
We'll tear down the penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)

Baby, let's ride the elevator  
Til we can rise some more

Cause suddenly you find your  
Self alone  
Suddenly you find yourself  
  
In an empty room  
With a suitcase on the floor  
It'll be daylight soon  
I'm gonna wage my private  
War  
  
Who's watchin' over me  
Must be a guardian angel  
I just need time to breathe  
And give my life  
The best of me

Time has slashed each untouched thing, so now he's just a stained class king  
  
Lethal, deadly, hung, drawn and quartered  
He slaughtered and faltered and altered the world  
But by doing so smashed all his hopes and Utopian dreams  
Whipping, stripping, peeling the flesh off, relentless and senseless  
His lust snapped like vipers whose fangs sank in deep  
To infest and decay from the core  
  
Impaled with betrayal, the tourniquet turns  
Society's creation, pole-axed out and burnt  
  
Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean now he's stained class  
Time has slashed each untouched thing, so now he's just a stained class king

My personal revenge will be the right  
Of our children in the schools and in the gardens  
My personal revenge will be to give you  
This song which has flourished without panic  
My personal revenge will be to show you  
The kindness in the eyes of my people  
Who have always fought relentlessly in battle  
And been generous and firm in victory  
My personal revenge will be to tell you good morning  
On a street without beggars or homeless  
When instead of jailing you I suggest  
You shake away the sadness there that blinds you  
And when you who have applied your hands in torture  
Are unable to look up at what surrounds you  
My personal revenge will be to give you  
These hands that once you so mistreated  
But have failed to take away their tenderness  
It was the people who hated you the most  
When rage became the language of their song  
And underneath the skin of this town today  
Its heart has been scarred forevermore  
It was the people who hated you the most

Don't wanna come down  
And I had a dream  
We went on a safari  
I said look at that lion, she reminds me of you  
Cause you're the queen  
And I had a dream  
That you were dying  
But I wasn't even crying, I just sang you to sleep  
I sang you to sleep

Oh, I had a dream  
What did it mean?

And I had a dream  
We robbed the record store  
The one with the yellow door  
We stole every goddamn record they had  
And I had a dream  
That I didn't give a fuck  
But I give a fuck  
I miss you so bad, I think I might die

And I had a dream  
We were being chased by a monster  
Maybe they were aliens  
But I wasn't scared cause you were there  
And I had a dream  
We took karate  
That's when you said you loved me  
You loved me

But you're gonna have to be,

Do you mean lower,  
When ancient beings first used tools?  
Or middle Palaeolithic,  
When Neanderthal ruled?  
  
That's when Homo sapiens,  
Starts to emerge.  
But just in Africa,  
It's long before the global surge.  
Not till upper Palaeolithic,  
Forty thousand years ago.  
Did Neanderthal and Homo sapiens say hello,  
Neanderthal and Homo sapi,  
Living in caveman harmony.  
  
Language was invented,  
Cave painting art.

Get all scientific.  
Palaeolithic's followed by,  
The era Mesolithic.  
Then Neanderthals are wiped out,  
By the ice age - horrific!  
After which the Neolithic age,  
Was terrific.  
  
Man learned to farm,  
Built homes so they could settle.  
Then some other folks turned up,  
And they discovered metal.  
Beaker men from Europe,  
Found bronze and outgrown.  
The simple and traditional ways of stone.  
  
Bronze Age was invented,  
By now man was flying.

Make amens  
  
Maybe, I need to see the daylight  
live beyond the half life  
don't you see I'm breaking down  
O, lately.... Something here don't feel right  
this is just a half life  
is there really no escape, no escape from time  
of any kind  
  
I keep trying to understand  
this thing and that thing my felo man  
I guess i'll let you know when I figure it out  
I don't mind a few mysteries they can stay that away  
It's fine by me but you are another mystery I am missing  
It takes too much out of me to pretend  
  
Maybe I need to see the day light  
live beyond the half life  
don't you see I'm breaking down  
O, lately... Something here don't feel right  
this is just a half life  
Is there really no escape, no escape from time  
or any kind  
  
C'mon lets fall in love  
well c'mon lets fall in love  
c'mon lets.... Fall in love.... Again  
  
Cause lately, something here don't feel right  
this is just a half life  
without you I get breaking down  
O, wake me  
I wanna see the day light  
save me from this half life  
let you and I escape  
escape from time  
  
C'mon lets fall in love  
c'mon lets fall in love  
c'mon lets fall in love....... Again

Escape,9,Run So Far,George Harrison,"You fly out as your smile wears thin  
I sigh knowing the mess you're in  
And you know that you can't get away  
And you know that you can't hide it from yourself  
Lonely days, blue guitar  
There's no escape, can only run so far  
  
I know something I ought to say  
Stuck here, trying to find a way  
And you know that you can't get away  
And you know that you can't hide it from yourself  
  
Lonely nights, travelling far  
There's no escape, can only run so far  
Lonesome tears, after dark  
There's no escape, can only run so far  
  
You fly out as your smile wears thin  
I sigh knowing the mess you're in  
And you know that you can't get away  
And you know that you can't hide it from yourself  
  
Lonely days, blue guitar  
There's no escape can only run so far  
Lonely nights, travelling far  
There's no way out, can only run so far  
Lonesome tears, after dark  
There's no escape, can only run so far

Escape,10,Neon Wilderness,Verve,"In a neon wilderness  
He was restless  
Escape loneliness  
Find a new address  
Stood before I sink  
In a neon wilderness  
Spill my last drink  
Yeah, he was restless  
Say good-bye to my new friends  
Escape from loneliness  
I found a new address  
In the last room  
I hear a boom  
Someone else's distress  
In a neon wilderness  
Someone else's distress  
In a neon wilderness  
And I hear a boom  
  
In a neon wilderness  
He was restless  
Escape loneliness  
For a new address  
  
In a neon wilderness  
He was restless  
Escape loneliness  
For a new address
