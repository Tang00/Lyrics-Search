Heartbreak,1,Heartbreaker,Grand Funk Railroad,"Once I had a little girl, sometimes I think about her,  
But, buddy, you know she's not really there.  
When memories do call, I just, I just can't live without her  
But tryin' all the time is so hard to bear.  
  
[Chorus]  
Heartbreaker, can't take her,  
Heartbreaker, bringing me down.  
Heartbreaker, can't take her,  
Heartbreaker, bringing me down.  
  
I don't cry no more, I live while I'm flying,  
But I'll think back, and you can hear me say:  
  
[Chorus x 3]  
  
Heartbreaker, can't take her,  
Heartbreaker, bringing me down.

Was a starving face on my TV screen  
The desperate face that I saw  
Had my disbelief hanging from my jaw  
Our harvest could be shared around  
Instead it's buried in the ground  
The saddest thing I've ever seen  
Was a football fan dying for his team  
The toughest thing I have ever known  
Was a soldier boy who never made it home  
It's fiction live before our eyes  
It leaves me cold and my heart cries  
  
The greatest thing I've ever seen  
Was a newborn child looking up at me  
The greatest sound I've ever heard  
Was a baby's cry in this wicked world  
The innocence of that cry  
Leaves me cold and my heart cries

WRITERS HANK WILLIAMS, HANK WILLIAMS JR.  
You're letter says you're unhappy we're many miles apart  
It's a little late to ask for pity,  
Remember you broke your own heart  
You walked out on the heart that loved you, has no pity from the start  
You cheated and lied and now you're gonna cry,  
Remember you broke your own heart  
A heart can stand so much sorrow and then it bends and breaks  
And a love that is honest and true can turn to bitter hate  
Now that you're gone and lonely, and your dreams have fallen apart  
Think of the one that once loved you,  
Remember you broke your own heart

Just a cage of rib bones and other various parts.  
So it's fairly simple to cut right through the mess.

We are so fragile,  
And our cracking bones make noise,  
And we are just,  
Breakable, breakable, breakable, girls and boys.  
  
You fasten my seatbelt because it is the law.  
In your two ton death trap I finally saw.  
A piece of love in your face that bathed me in regret.  
Then you drove me to places I'll never forget.

And our cracking bones make noise,  
And we are just,

And change the way the broken-hearted feel

And I'm sure missing her now  
  
When she said goodbye  
I was not sad enough to cry

Would end somehow  
Oh, but I'm sure missing her now

A different girl depending on my mood  
But the dance floor is no place for a lonesome heart  
And I'd wind up nailed to a barstool

Telling you I'm doing wrong

All of the intimate things  
That we ever might have said  
In the heat of a passionate moment  
In a conversation shared  
For the ears of nobody else  
There are some things they will never hear  
There are secrets I'll never tell

Will you lend me your ear  
Do you know the meaning of emptiness

Alone, alone  
Nobody knows how lonely it can be  
And he was tired of being alone

Tell me you love me  
Say I'm the only one  
  
Experiences have a lasting impression  
But words once spoken  
Don't mean a lot now

The way of the innocent  
And when I say innocent  
I should say naive  
So lie to me  
But do it with sincerity  
Make me listen  
Just for a minute  
Make me think  
There's some truth in it

Aren't necessarily  
What we need

Merely half-truth  
So lie to me  
Like they do it in the factory  
Make me think  
That at the end of the day  
Some great reward  
Will be coming my way

And wraps a fucking ? onto my head and to my vest  
Walking down the stret, my next door neighbours not impressed  
I'm a robot and buying ten fags is my quest

He's covered in tinfoil and he's got matching metal socks  
We tried to sedate him but he fucking escaped  
The man robot myth starts to escalate

For many years, this had been my wet dream  
Now I've reched it, I'm finally there

So alone, when people stop and stare  
Like C3PO but with pubes and hair

They said he was an headcase

And buy's ten fags  
Do's you's compute?  
  
He wants to buy ten fags, his destination is the shops  
A tinfoil suit and a hat like Robocop  
If your ask him then he'll do a bodypop  
Like terminator, yeah he just won't stop  
  
Put electical cable down through the eye of his cock  
Plugged it in the wall and gave himself a big shock  
The reason that he did it wasn't to give himself pain  
Watching Terminator over again and again  
  
Fuck man, get him, fucking restrain him man  
get him fucking, fucking get him down man

They talk so slowly when they do  
They are rich they are poor  
Their illusions are gone  
They share one heart for two  
  
Their homes all smell of time  
Of old photographs  
And an old fashioned song  
Though you may live in town  
You live so far away  
When you've lived too long  
  
Have they laughed too much  
Do their dry voices crack  
Talking of things gone by  
Have they cried too much

To cloud the eye  
  
They tremble as they watch the old silver clock  
When day is through  
Tick tock oh so slow

It says I wait for you

Their bodies feel like lead  
They might look out a window  
Or else sit it a chair  
Or else they stay in bed  
  
And if they still go out  
Arm in arm, arm in arm  
In the morning chill  
Its to have a good cry  
To say their last goodbye  
To one who's older still  
And then they go home  
To the old silver clock  
When day is through  
Tick tock so so slow  
It says yes it says no  
It says I wait for you

They just put down their heads  
And go to sleep one day  
They will hold each others hands  
Like children in the dark  
But one will get lost anyway  
And the other will remain  
Just sitting in a room  
Which makes no sound

I'm glad to be alive.

Still you're not quite certain you know him.  
The smile turns into a grin,  
What do you owe him?  
You know you owe him.  
  
So if there's something you do well,  
Something you're proud of,  
Better to save some for yourself  
If that's allowed.  
The crowd will never know you,  
You'll hardly know yourself,  
They'll turn you round  
And blow you up till  
You think you're someone else.

And they need a young man.  
The job takes a young man.
